<h1>Unsolved problems and/or planned features</h1>

<br />
<p>Allow users to login and view the schedule and have their own schedule highlighted for ease of use.</p>
<p>Allow the manager to add employees to the list and have it connected to the employee when they sign up.</p>
<p>Speed up the drop down selection process. As of now it feels to slow.</p>
<p>Clean up the code</p>
